#+DESCRIPTION: Nassim Taleb: Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails


* Setup
** Running Pluto

+ Setting =PLUTO_FAT_TAILS= allows for reuse of precompiled environment.
  - It works, but the environments don't age well.
  - When combined with the code in the =ch4= notebook, the Julia process can't manage its lifecycle properly.

#+begin_src sh
PLUTO_FAT_TAILS=1 julia --project=. --threads=auto -e "using Pluto; Pluto.run(4321)"
#+end_src
